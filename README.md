-------

To install Sharing4 in your own machine, your hosting needs to have:
* PHP5 interpreter.
* MySQL database server.

After cloning the repository, you need to change the config file placed at `include/config.php` to change your DB credentials and your Twitter/Facebook consumer key and secret.

Source code
-----------
As long as the source code was written to perform a final project for a subject of the [University of Oviedo](http://www.uniovi.es) (Basic Communication Services), the project is written and commented entirely in *Spanish*. If there is interest in the project it could be translated in the future.

Also, a **Model-View-Controller** pattern was used during the development of thsi software, written without using any existing PHP framework.
